    <br/>
    <p>At Apptega, LLC (&ldquo;Apptega&rdquo;), your privacy is important to us. We are committed to protecting your privacy
        in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy details certain policies implemented throughout Apptega
        governing Apptega&rsquo; use of personally identifiable information about users of our website located at www.Apptega.com/archived-site
        (&ldquo;Site&rdquo;) and users of our Apptega software and related services that are accessed through the Site
        (collectively, the &ldquo;Service&rdquo;).</p>

    <h5>Registration and Collection of Personal Information, Aggregate Information and Use of &ldquo;Cookies&rdquo;</h5>
    <br/>
    <p><i>Personally Identifiable Information</i></p>
    <p>You do not have to register or provide any personally identifiable information to visit our Site. However, some of
        the features offered through our Site or our Service may require you to register and provide your name, address,
        phone number, job title, company, email address, screen name and a password. &nbsp;For example, if you desire to
        download software or submit a request for a Apptega representative to contact you, Apptega will ask you to complete
        a registration form. Your registration information is used to provide and otherwise administer the services and/or
        products you request. &nbsp;We may also use the personally identifiable information you provide to help us understand
        our customers and to tailor and enhance our product and service offerings. If you decide not to provide us with
        personally identifiable information, you will still be able to use certain parts of our website, but there may
        be some features or services that are unavailable to you. &nbsp;We may also collect information about you from
        the log-in process, your use of the Site and/or the Service, cookies, chat or message boards, surveys or questionnaires
        or communications initiated by us or you via e-mail, phone or postal mail or in-person. We may also collect personally
        identifiable information about you from our third-party affiliate or partner companies and from marketing or advertising
        companies that provide us with such information as a part of their relationship with us. &nbsp;If you are an employee
        of a company that has registered to use the Service, your employer may submit to Apptega your name and e-mail address
        as part of registering you for the Service.</p>
    <br/>
    <p><i>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</i></p>
    <p>The Site may track your IP address, Internet service provider (ISP), operating system, the website from which you
        arrived, and the time and date of your visit automatically as part of the operation of this Site. We may analyze
        this data for trends and statistics in the aggregate, but such information will be maintained, used and disclosed
        in aggregate form only and it will not contain personally identifiable information. Apptega may use this aggregate
        information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users&rsquo; movement, and gather broad demographic information
        for aggregate use and internal marketing purposes, for example, to see what pages are most frequently visited in
        order to improve the Site. &nbsp;We also collect information through the use of a technology called &ldquo;cookies.&rdquo;
        A cookie is a small file that a website can send to your browser, which is then stored on your system by your browser.
        If you are uncomfortable accepting cookies from our Site or any other, you can set your browser to notify you when
        a Site attempts to send you a cookie, giving you the opportunity to decide for yourself whether or not to accept
        the cookie. You can also set your browser to turn off cookies.</p>
    <br/>
    <h5>Use of Personally Identifiable Information</h5>
    <p>Apptega may use the personally identifiable information we collect through the Site to register you to use our Service,
        process your requests for additional information and contact you to deliver certain services or information you
        have requested, verify your authority to enter our Site, improve the content and general administration of the
        Site and the Service, provide you with notices regarding goods or services that you have purchased or may wish
        to purchase in the future, and for targeted online advertising. We may use your personally identifiable information
        for additional marketing purposes if you consent to such use at the time you register to use our Site. &nbsp;We
        will not process personally identifiable information in a way that is incompatible with the purposes for which
        it has been collected or subsequently authorized by you. To the extent necessary for those purposes, we take reasonable
        steps to ensure that the data we maintain is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.</p>
    <br/>
    <h5>Disclosures and Onward Transfers</h5>
    <p>We will not disclose, trade, rent, sell or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information without your
        consent, except as otherwise set out herein.</p>
    <br/>
    <p><i>Third Party Service Providers</i></p>
    <p>To enable us to more efficiently provide the products and services you have requested from us, we may share your
        personally identifiable information with selected third parties who fulfill orders or perform other services on
        our behalf. We may also use third party payment processing companies to bill you for goods and services, or for
        other purposes within the ordinary course of business. Apptega is not liable for the acts or omissions of these
        third parties except to the extent required by applicable law. &nbsp;You acknowledge that the collection, transfer,
        storage, and processing of your personally identifiable information may be undertaken by these selected third parties
        for the purpose for which the data was collected. Our service providers are given the information they need to
        perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose personally identifiable information
        for their own marketing or other purposes. They are also expected to provide at least the same level of privacy
        protection to your personally identifiable information as afforded by this Privacy Policy. &nbsp;</p>
    <br/>
    <p><i>Other Circumstances Under Which We Disclose Your Information</i></p>
    <p>We will disclose your personally identifiable information if we reasonably believe we are required to do so to comply
        with applicable law, regulation or governmental authority, including, without limitation, any valid legal process
        such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute or court order or applicable law. We will also disclose your personal
        information to enforce the Apptega Terms of Use and to protect the rights, property or safety of Apptega&rsquo;
        licensors and/or users of the Site and Service.</p>
    <br/>
    <h5>Transfer of Business Assets</h5>
    <p>Apptega reserves the right to transfer or assign your personally identifiable information to our successor in the
        event of a merger with, acquisition of, or acquisition by or consolidation with a third-party company, to a purchaser
        of all or substantially all of Apptega&rsquo; assets to which the Site relates or in connection with any other
        corporate reorganization in which Apptega participates.</p>
    <br/>
    <h5>Processing of Personal Information</h5>
    <p>Our computer systems are currently based in the United States, so your personal data will be processed by us in the
        U.S. where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts
        of the world, such as the European Union. If you create a user account with the Site as a visitor from outside
        the United States, by using the Site you agree to this Privacy Policy and you consent to the transfer of all such
        information to the United States, which may not offer an equivalent level of protection of that required in the
        European Union or certain other countries, and to the processing of that information as described in this Privacy
        Policy.</p>
    <br/>
    <h5>Third Party Sites</h5>
    <p>This Site may contain links to other sites that Apptega does not own or operate. Also, links to our Site may be featured
        on third party websites on which we advertise. Except as provided herein, we will not provide any of your personally
        identifiable information to these third parties without your consent. We provide links to third party websites
        as a convenience to the user. These links are not intended as an endorsement of or referral to the linked websites.
        We recommend you read carefully the privacy statements, notices and terms of use of any linked websites. We do
        not have any control over such websites, and therefore we have no responsibility or liability for the manner in
        which the organizations that operate such linked websites may collect, use or disclose, secure and otherwise treat
        your personally identifiable information.</p>
    <br/>
    <h5>Security and the Nature of the Internet</h5>
    <p>It is Apptega&rsquo;s intent to protect any personally identifiably information that you submit to us against unauthorized
        access to or unauthorized disclosure, alteration or destruction., and Apptega employs reasonable procedural and
        technological security measures to maintain the security of the personally identifiable information we may collect
        and process. &nbsp;Apptega may use encryption, firewalls, password protection, and physical lock and key to help
        prevent unauthorized access to your personally identifiable information. We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to encrypt
        your personally identifiable information while it is transferred between your machine and our servers. Apptega
        may also place internal restrictions on who in the company may access data to help prevent unauthorized access
        to your personally identifiable information. &nbsp;Despite our safeguards, the nature of the Internet is such that
        data may be intercepted by unauthorized third parties regardless of any security measures that may be in place.
        Therefore, in submitting personally identifiable information to the Site, you assume the risk of an unauthorized
        third party obtaining that information.</p>
    <br/>
    <h5>Children&rsquo;s Usage of the Site</h5>
    <p>Apptega recognizes the privacy interests of children, and Apptega encourages parents and guardians to take an active
        role in their children&rsquo;s online activities and interests. &nbsp;This Site and the Service is targeted to
        adults only and not to children under 13. The Site and the Service are not intended for children under the age
        of 13, and Apptega endeavors not to collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age
        of 13.</p>

        accept all of the terms of Apptega&rsquo;s Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use this Site and/or

        Privacy Policy on the Site on this page and send an e-mail notification to the e-mail address of record for you
        or a company&rsquo;s Program Manager or contract signatory of record, as applicable, so that you are always aware
